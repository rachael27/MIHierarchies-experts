# MIHierarchies

This repository will help you set up the MergedTree visualization for comparing two hierarchies. One hierarchy is given prominence over the other and is known as the primary hierarchy. The other hierarchy is called the secondary hierarchy. The positioning of the elements in the MergedTree is influenced by the elements' positioning in the primary hierarchy.

The index.html is the index file. Users are provided with multiple primary and secondary hierarchy files that can be played with so they can understand the functioning of the MergedTree. The path to these files must be changed in the mtree.html file and treewlinking.html for the MergedTree and the LinkedTree visualizations, respectively.
